Before calling an interface, interface authentication must be performed first. HuanYaMoFang supports multiple ways to authenticate interfaces, making interface calls easy and flexible. Moreover, it can also achieve functions such as single sign-on, validating login status, and logging out, making interface calls even more flexible and convenient.

## Call the login interface to obtain user identity

Starting from version 2.2.52, the platform supports calling the interface for login using an unencrypted password.

POST /accounts/password/login

```json
{
  "user": { "email": "test@example.com"},
  "password-unencrypted": "xxx"
}
```

This interface returns the token.

Use ${spaceId} and ${token} to verify

```javascript
Authorization : Bearer ${spaceId},${token}
```

## Use current browser user identity verification

The current browser has user login information stored in the localStorage, which includes:

- steedos:userId
- steedos:token
- steedos:spaceId

Use ${spaceId} and ${token} to verify

```javascript
Authorization : Bearer ${spaceId},${token}
```

## Use administrator API key verification

If you need to call the interface uniformly as an administrator, you can log in to the system as an administrator, and on the Settings-Advanced Settings-API Key menu, get the administrator's API Key.

```javascript
Authorization : Bearer apikey,${apikey}
```

The administrator API Key needs to be properly kept and this method can only be used for server-side calls.
