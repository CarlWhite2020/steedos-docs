# The Basics

In this tutorial, we will create a simple Todos application using Steedos. This application will allow users to add, view, and manage their to-do tasks. We will cover creating custom objects and fields, building applications and tabs, creating list views, and configuring object permissions.


```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList/>
```
