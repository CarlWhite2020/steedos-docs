# Customize Your Steedos Org

You can customize each of the standard tabs and types of records, including adding custom fields and setting page layouts. 

## Customize Objects

Steedos lets you personalize your object model with features like custom fields, page layouts, and validation rules. 

## Control User Access to Fields

Use field-level security to control user access to fields. Use page layouts to control the layout and organization of detail and edit pages in Steedos.

## Set Page Layouts and Field-Level Security

Use field-level security as the means to restrict usersâ€™ access to fields; then use page layouts primarily to organize detail and edit pages within tabs. This reduces the number of page layouts for you to maintain. For example, if a field is required in the page layout and read only in the field-level security settings, the field-level security overrides the page layout and the field will be read only for the user.

## Page Layouts

Page layouts control the layout and organization of buttons, fields, and related lists on object record pages. They also help determine which fields are visible, read only, and required. Use page layouts to customize the content of record pages for your users.

## Rename Object, Tab, and Field Labels

You can change the name of almost any object, field, or tab in Steedos. This simple adjustment lets you continue using the terminology your users already know and helps them transition to using Steedos.
