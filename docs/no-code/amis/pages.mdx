Steedos is designed based on a micro-page architecture and provides visual design tools. You can customize every interface of the system, including object list pages, record detail pages, form pages, and standalone application pages (such as dashboards).

## Micro Page Engine

Steedos's micro-page engine supports the design of different types of pages within the system. The types of pages that can be designed include:

* Application pages: Completely new pages that can be used to design enterprise business data dashboards, cockpit data pages, etc.
* Record pages: Detail pages of data records.
* List pages: Object data list pages.
* Form pages: Data creation and editing pages.

In addition to designing pages, it also supports designing business operation buttons through the designer to achieve complex business interface interactive operations.

### Application Pages

If you need to customize a brand new application page, you can use this type of micro-page. It allows you to add a new custom page designed with Amis to the system. By binding it to a tab, users can access this page through the tab.

For example, we may need to configure a homepage for the project application, displaying various project receipts, payment statistics curves or histograms, and related list data.

### Record Pages

Sometimes what we need is not to customize a brand new application page, but to customize a certain business object, such as the record page of a contract object, to replace the system's built-in record page to achieve personalized record detail page display effects.

### List Pages

Similar to the record page, the "List Page" type of micro-page is used to customize a certain business object, such as the list page of a contract object, to replace the system's built-in list page to achieve personalized list page display effects.

### Forms

Similar to record pages, the "Form" type of micro-page is for customizing a certain business object, like the form of a contract object, to replace the built-in form effects that pop up when creating or editing records.

Unlike record pages, the "Form" type of micro-page only replaces the popped-up form interface and does not affect the read-only interface effects of the record details page. In contrast, the "Record Page" type of micro-page replaces the entire read-only effect of the record details page but does not affect the popped-up form interface.

## Micro Page Designer

We have integrated the Amis visual designer in Steedos's micro-pages, allowing the design of highly customized interface effects.

![Amis Designer](/img/amis/amis-designer.png)

In the integrated designer in Steedos, there are different types of components available for users to use:
* Native components: Steedos adapts native Baidu Amis standard components for design use by users.
* Cube components: Components corresponding to the standardization of Steedos system pages, such as list views, object tables, related tables, etc. Compared to native components, cube components only need simple configuration to use.
* Custom components: Steedos platform supports the custom component function. Once the component is published, the designer can use it.

## Creating a Custom Page

First, enter the "Settings" application, click the "User Interface->Micro Page" menu on the left, and then click the "New" button in the upper right corner to start creating a micro page.

- Api name: Please enter an Api name that does not duplicate with other micro pages.
- Name: Please enter the display name for the micro page.
- Renderer: Please select Amis.
- Status: Used to control whether the micro page is available.
- Object: When the type is “record page”, “list page”, or “form”, you need to select the object to be bound.

When creating a "form, list page, record page," a well-designed default [Page Version](#page-version) is automatically generated for user secondary development.

### Designing the Page

After the micro page is created, we can click the "Designer" button at the top right to open the micro page designer and design the page.

### Configuring Permissions

After publishing the designed micro page, we need to configure access permissions for each micro page to make it visible to the end-user. We set permissions through "Page Allocation."

We can distribute the designed pages according to different business scenarios, meaning we can let users see different page effects when accessing different applications or under different profiles.

In the micro page record detail interface, you can see a subtable list called "Page Allocation." We can click the "New" button in the upper right corner of this list to create a new page allocation record.

- Authorization Type: Please select the authorization type to configure. There are three options: organization default settings, application default settings, application, and profile.
- Page: The current micro page will be automatically selected, no need to change.
- Application: When the authorization type is "application default settings" or "application and profile," you need to choose under which application the micro page is effective.
- Profile: When the authorization type is "application and profile," in addition to selecting the application, you also need to select under which profile the micro page is effective.
- Desktop: Checking this means that the micro page will be displayed on the desktop.
- Mobile: Checking this means that the micro page will be displayed on mobile devices.

We can create multiple page allocation records for the same micro page, and they will all take effect.

The table below describes the differences in the scope of micro page authorization for the three types of authorization supported in page allocation:

| Authorization Type | Authorized Application | Authorized Profile |
|----|----|----|
| Organization Default Settings | All Applications | All Profiles |
| Application Default Settings | Specified Application Only | All Profiles |
| Application and Profile | Specified Application Only | Specified Profile Only |

Users within the micro page authorization range can see the page effects customized with AMIS, while users outside the authorization range will see the system's default page effects.

For example, suppose we designed a micro page using the AMIS engine for the contract object, and we authorized it only for the "contract administrator" profile during page allocation. In that case, the contract administrator will see our customized micro page when viewing contract record details, while other users will see the default contract record details page effects.

### Display in Applications

Assuming we have already designed and published a page, the following steps describe how to bind a micro page of the "application page" type to a tab and make it visible to the end user.
- Enter the "Settings" application, click the "User Interface->Tabs" menu on the left, and then click the "New" button in the upper right corner to create a tab.
- When creating a new tab, select "Page" for the "Type" and then choose the micro page we just published in the "Page" attribute.
- Click the "Applications->Applications" menu on the left of the "Settings" application, create a new application or edit an existing one, and select the newly created tab in the tab attributes of the application.
- After refreshing the browser, click the grid in the upper left corner, and in the pop-up "Application Launcher," click to enter the newly created application.
- At this point, you can see the newly created tab in the top navigation bar. Clicking this tab will take you to the customized page we designed with AMIS earlier.

### Publishing

After the page design is complete, we need to click the "Publish" button in the upper right corner of the designer or the micro page record detail interface to publish the page content designed in the designer. Both publish buttons are the same.

It should be noted that each time you modify the design in the designer, you need to click the publish button after publishing to let the end user see the latest designed effects.

The publishing operation actually marks the current latest "Page Version" as the "Published" status, and the page content seen by the end user is also the latest published version of the page.

## Page Version

The first time you save the design content in the designer, a page version will be generated. We can see it in the "Page Versions" subtable in the micro page record detail interface.

Each time you click the publish button, the latest page version will be marked as "Published," and each time you modify and save a previously published micro page in the designer, a new unpublished page version will be generated.

The page content we design in the designer is ultimately saved to each page version in [AMIS Schema](https://aisuda.bce.baidu.com/amis/zh-CN/docs/types/schemanode) form. If you are familiar with AMIS Schema syntax, you can also directly modify it in the page version.

## Creating URL Tabs

By creating tabs, you can display micro pages in custom applications. If you need to implement a micro page with parameters, you can create an "External Link" type tab and configure its link address as the micro page access address.

The micro page access address format is `/app/${appApiName}/page/${pageApiName}[?dynamic parameters]`, with the following rules:

- appApiName is the API name of the application.
- pageApiName is the API name of the micro page.
- The parameters after the '?' are optional, following the regular [URL Query](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) parameter writing method.

For example, configuring the external link as `/app/oa/page/oa_home?company_id=619383545b2e9a72ec0558b3` means that when you click the tab, it opens the micro page configured under the application with the API name "oa" with the API name "oa_home," while passing in a parameter named "company_id."

With the formula script feature, we only need to configure the external link address of the tab above as ``{{`/app/oa/page/oa_home?company_id=${global.user.company_id}`}}``, and we can dynamically pass the "division" value of the current logged-in user to the "affiliated company" parameter of the micro page.

The method mentioned above is only suitable for micro pages of the "application page" type. Other types of


## About Amis Framework

Amis is a low-code front-end framework open-sourced by Baidu. It uses JSON configuration to generate pages, reducing the workload of page development and greatly enhancing efficiency. [Visit the official Amis website](https://aisuda.bce.baidu.com/amis/zh-CN/docs/index)

* **Provides a complete interface solution**: Other UI frameworks require JavaScript for assembling business logic, while Amis can complete full functionality development with just JSON configuration, including data fetching, form submission, and validation, etc. The pages produced are ready to go online without secondary development.
* **Numerous built-in components (120+), one-stop solution**: Most other UI frameworks only have the most common components, and you have to find third-party ones for less common components, which often differ in presentation and interaction, leading to poor integration. Amis, however, has a wide variety of built-in components, including rich text editors, code editors, diffs, conditional combinations, real-time logs, and other business components, covering most needs in back-end page development with just Amis knowledge.
* **Supports extension**: In addition to the low-code mode, you can also expand components through [custom components](https://aisuda.bce.baidu.com/amis/zh-CN/docs/extend/internal), treating Amis as a regular UI library, achieving a hybrid mode of 90% low-code and 10% traditional code development, enhancing efficiency without losing flexibility.
* **Container supports unlimited nesting**: You can meet various layout and presentation needs through nesting.
* **Endured the test of long-term practical application**: Amis is widely used within Baidu, **creating 50,000 pages over more than 6 years**, from content auditing to machine management, from data analysis to model training, Amis meets a wide range of page needs, with the most complex pages having over 10,000 lines of JSON configuration.
