# Build Your Own Steedos Application

An app is a collection of items that work together to serve a particular function. 

The platform includes innovative point-and-click app-building tools that give you the power to customize Steedos to meet the needs of your business. You can also build your own apps to share and store information that is important to you. You don’t need any programming knowledge to use these tools.

Steedos apps are a collection of standard and custom tabs, including:

- Most standard objects, including Home, the main Tasks, Calendar, and People
- Your org’s custom objects
- Micro page tabs
- Web tabs

Steedos provides standard apps such as Sales and Projects.

When you choose an app, your screen changes to reflect the contents of that app. For example, if you switch from an app that contains Projects to another app that doesn’t, the Projects item disappears. In addition, the app might display a different default landing tab when selected.

Apps are associated with profiles. Profiles control which tabs you can see or hide, as well as which apps are available to you.
