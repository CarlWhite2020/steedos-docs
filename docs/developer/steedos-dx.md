# How Steedos Developer Experience Changes the Way You Work

Steedos Developer Experience (DX) is a new way to manage and develop apps on the Steedos Low-Code Platform across their entire lifecycle. It brings together the best of the Low-Code Platform to enable source-driven development, team collaboration with governance, and new levels of agility for custom app development on Steedos.

Highlights of Steedos DX include:

- Your tools, your way. With Steedos DX, you use the developer tools you already know.
- The ability to apply best practices to software development. Source code and metadata exist outside of the org and provide more agility to develop Steedos apps in a team environment. Instead of the org, your version control system is the source of truth.
- A powerful command-line interface (CLI) removes the complexity of working with your Steedos org for development, continuous integration, and delivery.
- You can use any IDE or text editor you want with the CLI and externalized source.
- Steedos Extensions for VS Code to accelerate app development. These tools provide features for working with metadata, triggers, page components, and api.
