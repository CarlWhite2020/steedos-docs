# Microservice Architecture Overview

The Steedos Platform is based on the Moleculer microservices architecture. Moleculer is a fast, modern and powerful microservices framework for Node.js. It helps you to build efficient, reliable & scalable services. 


## Service

A service is a simple nodejs module containing some part of a complex application. It is isolated and self-contained, meaning that even if it goes offline or crashes the remaining services would be unaffected.

## Node

A node is a simple OS process running on a local or external network. A single instance of a node can host one or many services.

## Networking

In order to communicate with other nodes (Steedos Platform) you need to configure a transporter. Most of the supported transporters connect to a central message broker that provide a reliable way of exchanging messages among remote nodes. These message brokers mainly support publish/subscribe messaging pattern.

## Service Broker

The ServiceBroker is the main component of Moleculer. It handles services, calls actions, emits events and communicates with remote nodes. You must create a ServiceBroker instance on every node.

## Transporter

Transporters is an important module if you are running services on multiple nodes. Transporter communicates with other nodes. It transfers events, calls requests and processes responses â€¦etc. If multiple instances of a service are running on different nodes then the requests will be load-balanced among them.

Steedos uses redis as the default Transporter.

```bash
TRANSPORTER=redis://127.0.0.1:6379
```
:::tip
Please make sure the TRANSPORTER you configured matches the Steedos server you wish to connect to and that the network is interconnected.

For running in a production environment, be sure to configure the Redis password.
