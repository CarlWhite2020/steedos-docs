By creating software packages, you can synchronize the metadata developed on the server-side with the code, enabling version management of metadata.

In addition, you can also write triggers, APIs, and microservices to expand the capabilities of Steedos.

## Package Structure

A steedos package stores custom objects and custom object translations in intuitive subdirectories. Source format makes it much easier to find what you want to change or update. And you can say goodbye to messy merges.

```bash
my-package
|   ├── main/                                    # Main code directory
|   |   ├── default/                             # Folder containing default code and content
|   |   |   ├── applications/                    # Custom applications
|   |   |   ├── objects/                         # Custom objects directory, containing definitions such as fields
|   |   |   |   ├── my_object/                   # Files and configurations for an individual custom object
|   |   |   |   |   ├── fields/                  # Contains fields for the custom object
|   |   |   |   |   ├── listviews/               # Custom list views for the object
|   |   |   |   |   ├── permissions/             # Permissions for the custom object
