By creating software packages, you can synchronize the metadata developed on the server-side with the code, enabling version management of metadata.

In addition, you can also write triggers, APIs, and microservices to expand the capabilities of Steedos.

## Define Package

Steedos defines packages based on standard npm specifications.

The directory structure of the package files is as follows:

```bash
package1
│   ├── main/default
│   ├── package.json
│   └── package.service.js
```

Each package contains at least the following content:

* `package.json`：Based on npmjs standard specifications, it defines the information of the package, used to describe the package name, version, and information of the dependencies. See [NPM Package](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json) for details.
* `package.service.js`：The package microservice, which is a microservice definition file following the Moleculer specifications. You can write code to control the operations executed when the package is loaded, started, or stopped. For more information, refer to [Moleculer Services](https://moleculer.services/docs/0.14/services.html).
* `main/default`: Stores metadata synchronized from the server, such as objects, fields, list views, permissions, etc.
