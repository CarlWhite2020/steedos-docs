# Project Setup

Steedos DX provides a project structure for your org’s metadata (code and configuration), org templates, sample data, and all your team’s tests. To bring consistency to your team’s development processes, store these items in a source control system (Git). Retrieve the contents of your team’s repository when you’re ready to develop a new feature.
