# Steedos Packages

Steedos is a potent low-code development platform that empowers users and developers to extend and enhance the platform's capabilities through its flexible plugin architecture. With Steedos packages, you can integrate new functionalities seamlessly, meet specific business needs, while maintaining the stability and reliability of the core system.

## What are Steedos Packages?

Steedos packages are independent software packages containing a set of predefined functionalities or services that can be directly integrated into the Steedos platform. These plugins can range from custom objects, user interfaces, business logic processing, or integrations with external systems, allowing for rapid expansion and customization of platform functionalities.

## Advantages of Steedos Packages

### Functional Expansion
Steedos Packages enable you to add specific functionalities that are outside the core capabilities of Steedos. Whether it's enhancing data processing capabilities, improving the user interface, or adding new reporting or analytical tools, plugins make all of this possible.

### Customized Integrations
If your business processes require integration with third-party services or other enterprise applications, Steedos plugins allow you to do so with ease. Steedos Packages can encapsulate communications with other systems, ensuring data synchronization and business process continuity.

### Ease of Maintenance
The independence of plugins makes maintenance simpler. You can update or modify a plugin without impacting other parts of the system. This modular approach reduces complexity in system upgrades and troubleshooting.

### Community and Marketplace Support
Due to the open nature of Steedos, many developers and partners develop and share their plugins. You can benefit from a rich plugin ecosystem, quickly finding solutions that fit your current needs.
