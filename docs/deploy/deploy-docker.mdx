Follow these steps to deploy Steedos on Docker.

## Prerequisites

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10.7 or later)
2. [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29.2 or later)


## Install Steedos

Create a folder named `steedos` on your machine for deployment and data storage. Then, navigate to this folder using the `cd` command and follow the steps below:

1. To download the `docker-compose.yml` file, run the following cURL command:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steedos/steedos-platform/master/deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml -o $PWD/docker-compose.yml
   ```
This command saves the file in the current directory.

2. Start the Docker container using the following command. You may need to run with `sudo` if you don't have permission to run `docker-compose`. 

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
If the image doesn't exist locally, this command downloads the necessary Docker image and starts the container.

3. Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) and wait for the server to come up. This can take up to 5 minutes. Once the server is up and running, you can access Steedos at [http://localhost](http://localhost).
